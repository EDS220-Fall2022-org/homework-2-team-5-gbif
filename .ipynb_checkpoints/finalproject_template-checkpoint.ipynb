    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of iNaturalist research grade observations. Research grade observations are defined by having a photo, date, and coordinate provided and the community agrees upon the identification. iNaturalist is a program that provides a social network for citizen scientists to upload photos of different species along with location and time collected. With a photo, iNaturalist is used to identify the species in the photo based on previous users’ uploads and community input. This data set was created and hosted by iNaturalist, an initiative by the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic Society. It is also hosted on GBIF. “GBIF- the Global Biodiversity Information Facility- is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world’s governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.” GBIF holds institutions around the world to similar data standards, allowing everyone access to consistent and reliable ecological data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iNaturalist dataset’s temporal span is from 1768 to present. Older data is based on historical records. The iNaturalist app was created in 2008, and people with iPhones have uploaded their own data via the app in recent years. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different ways that we can access iNaturalist data. iNaturalist does manage an export feature on their website, but they note that large exports slow down their infrastructure. Their top recommendation for exporting data is to use GBIF. The file format used to store the data is a tab -delimited CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues with data quality are highlighted by tags on the download report. Some of these issues include matching taxon to the correct identification, matching incorrect countries and coordinates, or multimedia date invalidities. \n"

    "Next, provide code to read in the data necessary for your analysis. This should be in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Import all necessary packages (matplotlib, numpy, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Set any parameters that will be needed during subsequent portions of the notebook. Typical examples of parameters include:\n",
    "- names of any directories where data are stored\n",
    "- ranges of years over which data are valid\n",
    "- any thresholds or latitude/longitude ranges to be used later (e.g. dimensions of NINO3.4 region, threshold SSTA values for El Nino, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Read in the data! If the data files are very large, you may want to consider subsetting the portion of files to be read in (see examples of this during notebooks provided in Weeks 7 and 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a good rule of thumb: It's good to aim for a relatively short amount of time needed to read in the data, since otherwise we'll be sitting around waiting for things to load for a long time. A  minute or two for data I/O is probably the max you'll want to target!"

    " \n",
    " - Create an _environment_ file: this is a text file which contains information on the packages needed in order to execute your code. The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",
